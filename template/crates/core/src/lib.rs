//! tool_core: every application rule of the tool.
//!
//! Builder requirement: this crate performs no input or output. It takes
//! values and returns values, so `cargo test` reaches every rule without a
//! browser. `tests/boundary.rs` enforces that, along with the dependency
//! allowlist and the reference ban on floats, hash maps and clocks.
//!
//! Replace the placeholder rule in `page.rs` with the rules your brief
//! describes. Keep `api.rs` as the one door the shim calls through.
