"""The project's own browser interactions, run by check.py in every engine.

check.py has already loaded the page, waited for it to report ready, and let
it idle. Drive the tool here the way a person would, and assert what the page
shows with `check(condition, "what this shows")`. Assert the effect a person
would see (the text drawn, the file saved), not the markup that should cause it.

Expected values in these checks are worked out by hand from the brief (C4),
never copied from the tool's own output.
