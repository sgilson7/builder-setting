//! Saves that survive a deploy. Part of the saves kit (`kits/saves/README.md`).
//!
//! The core owns the save: what is in it, its version, and how a save from
//! an older build becomes one this build can use. The page stores the text
//! the core gives it (`web/save/store.js`) and hands it back; it never looks
//! inside. A save this build cannot read is refused and kept, never
//! overwritten, so a bad deploy costs a reload and not a player's progress.
//!
//! Every change to what a save holds bumps `VERSION` and adds one step to
//! `migrate`. `tests/old_saves.rs` loads a save written by every deployed
//! build (`tests/saves/`), and the project writes one more before each
//! deploy. A field an old save holds either reaches `Save` or is listed in
//! `DROPPED` with the reason, because the loader refuses fields it does not
//! know.
//!
//! The example `Save` is a small idle game's: wood, and a level per skill.
//! Replace it with the project's own; keep `load`, `store`, `migrate` and the
//! tests.
